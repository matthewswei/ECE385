## Lab Report Grades

	Lab 1: 11.5/15
		- -1: Postlab Q1 diagram annotated wrong, should include unknown regions caused by stablizing. -0.5: Postlab Q2 should mention the use of pull-up resistors. -2: Missing General Guide questions.
	Lab 2:  19/20
		- -1: For moduel description, you need to follow the format given by lab mannual and should list all the input and outputs.
	Lab 3: 13.5/15
		- -0.5: Annotation of simulation trace not visiable -1: Our 4x4 design is not ideal, an ideal design would have the ripple time through each subsequent adder equivalent to the MUX delay time. The first block would be very small (1-bit) the next block would be the delay of the first block + 1 mux delay, the next block would be that plus 2 mux delays, etc...
	Lab 4:  15/15
	Lab 5:  20/20
	Lab 6:  20/20
	Lab 7:   19/20
		- -1: For lab 7.1 block diagram you should include a inside view of vga_text_avl_interface, and also include the modification to account for address calculations.
	Final Project: 20/20
